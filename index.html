<h3>in computer engineering, computer architecture is a set of rules and methods that describe the functionality, organization, and implementation of computer systems.

  Some definitions of architecture define it as describing the capabilities and programming model of a computer but not a particular implementation.[1] In other definitions computer architecture involves instruction set architecture design, microarchitecture design, logic design, and implementation.
